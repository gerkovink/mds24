This year Hanne Oberman and I published a paper on the evaluation of imputation routines. You should read it! You may find it [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/bimj.202200107).

Also, together with Mingyang Cai and Stef van Buuren, we published another paper. Find it yourself.
